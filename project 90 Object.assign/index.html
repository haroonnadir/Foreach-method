    <h1>Object.assign</h1>
Object.assign is a method in JavaScript that is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It is often used to merge or combine objects.
Syntax:
The basic syntax of Object.assign is as follows:

Merging Objects:
You can use Object.assign to merge properties from multiple source objects into a single target object.

Overwriting Properties:
If the target object already has a property with the same key, the value of that property will be overwritten by the source object's value.

Copying to an Empty Object:
You can also use Object.assign to create a new object with properties copied from another object.
