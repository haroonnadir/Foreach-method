    <h1> Sets </h1>
In JavaScript, a Set is a built-in object that allows you to store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references. A Set can be used to efficiently store a collection of distinct values and is often used to manage lists of unique items.
Creating a Set:
To create a new Set, you can use the Set constructor and pass an iterable (such as an array) containing the initial values for the Set.

Adding and Removing Values:
You can use the add method to add new values to a Set, and the delete method to remove values from it.

Checking for Value Existence:
You can use the has method to check if a specific value exists in the Set.

Iterating Over a Set:
You can use a for...of loop to iterate over the elements of a Set.

Size of the Set:
You can use the size property to get the number of elements in the Set.
