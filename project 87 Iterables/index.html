<H1>Iterables</H1>
In JavaScript, an iterable is an object that implements the Iterable protocol, which allows it to be iterated over using a loop or other constructs that support iteration. Iterables include arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. An iterable provides a standardized way to access its elements sequentially.
<H3>Iterable Protocol:</H3>
An object is considered iterable if it has a method with the key Symbol.iterator that returns an iterator. The iterator is an object with a next method that returns an object with properties value (the current value) and done (a boolean indicating whether the iteration is complete).
<H3>sing Iterables:</H3>
To iterate over an iterable, you can use a for...of loop, the spread operator, or the Array.from method. These constructs automatically handle iteration over the iterable.
<H3>Custom Iterables:</H3>
You can create your own iterable objects by implementing the Symbol.iterator method that returns an iterator. The iterator must have a next method that returns the next value and whether the iteration is complete.
